# order_system
A prototype of an lightweight PHP/MySQL online shop.
Its a training project, but it offers interfaces, that can be used in
realistic projects.
With the system you can simulate a closed system:
User for buying products.
Administrator for managing products and monitoring the system.
Provider for ship products.
Every user type has an account overview and management and register functionalities.
